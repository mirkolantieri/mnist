# MNIST Prediction

In this notebook, will be described the approach used to build a Convolutional Neural Network for MNIST digits dataset of input shape 28x28x1 and number of classes equal to 10. The main objective within this notebook is to reach the highest possible accuracy on the test set (valdation), with the maximum hard constraint of 7000 learnable parameters. The code is available at `main.ipynb` Jupyter notebook, including the description of the steps.
